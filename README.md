Desc      : PCBOT, a website aimed to help PC enthusiasts and the like with their computer mishaps and confusions, and guide them with the best information. In this pandemic, many people need the power that suits their workflow while they are working at studying at home. That is why we made this website to hopefully ease people's lives. We also offer some features that can help them find certain parts easily and with a complete description. You can search for certain products and get specific information on them, you could also get links to e-stores where products are sold the cheapest, and you can make a list of parts to create a PC and help you find the best configurations.

Features:

“BotBuilder” is a service where people can choose whatever aspect of PC components to begin with. Then the system will analyze the component chosen to match other aspects, which are the compatible ones, until every component is selected. Lastly, it will provide the total price of the components, but they can’t buy the parts from us and instead, are given links to sites such as amazon, newegg, best-buy, and etc.

“ListProducts” is a service where people can search their wanted components and find details for it. There are features such as filters for brands, price, and more, and can also sort for the latest launched products, highest prices, lowest prices, and more.

“ProductPreview”, there will be a list of details of the product such as name, price, pictures, specs, and many more. Also, there will be a link that directs the user to the local e-commerce where they can actually buy the product.

“BotRecommend”, after people use our service, their selected components will be stored with us and will come out as a recommendation of a completely built PC, with all of the components and price.
